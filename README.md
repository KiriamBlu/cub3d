# cub3d
 This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90’s game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.

 Write in terminal "make redo" to compile and execute program.
 "make install" will install the requirements to compile. Mainly the MLX graphic library.
